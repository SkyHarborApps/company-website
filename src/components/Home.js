      I have been working in the software industry since 2008. I have a background in both Software Engineering and Marketing. My experience has made me understand that real and profitable innovation is the result of these two areas working tightly together. Peter Drucker, management guru says it best:

      “A successful innovation aims at leadership [within a given market or industry]… If an innovation does not aim at leadership from the beginning, it is unlikely to be innovative enough, and therefore unlikely to be capable of establishing itself."

      My focus and specialty is making high quality, and highly relevant software. Oh and most importantly, have FUN doing it!
